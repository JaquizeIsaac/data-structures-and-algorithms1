# Binary Search
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Binary search in a sorted 1D array

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I think I did a fairly standard approach. Set the left and right extremes, divide them by two, check value, and then set either extreme to mid +/- 1 if too low/high.
Time complexity should be O(log n) and space complexity should be constant.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
def binary_search(arr, value):
    if not isinstance(arr, list):
        raise TypeError("No")

    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == value:
            return mid

        elif arr[mid] < value:
            left = mid + 1

        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return -1
```
